#### Object Based Image Analysis {#sec-7-sum-obia}

Last week (@sec-6-summary) we looked at using the more traditional approach of pixel-based classification whereas since the late 1990s object based classification has become increasingly popular through Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA).

OBIA groups pixels into an object type which are then used as training data for the actual analysis.

The basic steps for all these forms of classification are expertly summarised by @gisgeography2014 and the steps involved can by shown in @fig-classification-infographic which also shows how OBIA has increased in popularity since 2006.

There is a clear trend of increased OBIA use from 2012 and it's unfortunate that an updated version of this infographic is not available. However this does illustrate a shift toward OBIA, this is due to higher accuracy results and classifications especially in high-resolution imagery. This approach is more closely aligned to the human visual interpretation of images rather than a pixel based approach and the key to this is segmentation before classification takes place.

## Application {#sec-7-application}

Image classification has a vast array of use cases as mentioned previously, however lets concentrate on to comparison between pixel based approaches and object based.

The pixel based approaches includes minimum distance and maximum likelihood algorithms whereas the segmentation approach used by OBIA allows for consideration of colour, scale and texture (@amalisana2017). Pixel based is often cited as producing a "salt and pepper" output which equates to more noise as individual pixels can be misclassified. Using the segmentation of OBIA this effect is greatly reduced and builds a clearer picture of how an area is built (@fig-pixel-v-object). Here we can see how much clearer the classification of the object based approach is and particularly it's accuracy at identifying the Cisadane river running through the city which is not visible at all in the pixel-based output. @amalisana2017 state that pixel based classifications calculated that the accuracy of object based classification was 82.15% where as pixel based only 61.481%.

---------*add caveat about accuracy figures*-------------

![Pixel-based versus object-based classification of Bogor City in 2016. Source:](images/pixel_v_object_classification.png){#fig-pixel-v-object fig-align="center"} For general land cover we've seen a clear example where OBIA out-performs pixel-based however there are other examples where pixel-based may be the preferred option. Picking the study of wetlands and the work of @norris2024 where they found using Random Forest classifiers on both pixel and object-based approach that pixel-based was more accurate. This could be attribute to a few variables but most likely the small study area and the number of small-sized plants at the study sites. They also state the key importance of selection of input features, as an vegetation based study it is best to use the images at times of year where the vegetation is developed or flowering.

So whilst, OBIA appeared to be the obvious choice for classification we must always consider the use case as well as other variables such as image collection dates, spatial resolution and the specific study aims. Overall we must ensure that the use case is clearly defined before finalising methodology or perhaps compare the results ourselves in our research to ensure that the right option guides our decision making.
