# Policy Applications

## Introduction {#sec-4-intro}

### London {#sec-london}

-   Capital and most populous city in the UK
-   Covers area of over 1,500 square kilometres
-   Diverse population of over 8.5 million (@ons2021)
-   Varying land cover of high density urban juxtaposed with large amount being green areas (@gla2025).
-   World's first National Park City - 50% green land cover by 2050 (@gla2025).
-   Administration split into 32 boroughs with unique geographies, social demographics and autonomy.

### London Plan {#sec-london-plan}

London Plan is the strategic development strategy for the city. It sets out the metropolitan policies with the administrative boroughs following policies to meet economic, social and environmental responsibilities. The scope is very broad, covering topics of building design, heritage, housing, economy and transport.

#### GG3 Good Growth - Creating a healthy city {#sec-gg3}

Policy GG3 encompasses different approaches in it's objectives @tbl-london_plan_gg3 with a key aspect being reduction of health problems caused by inactivity through greater access to open spaces which specifically relate to GG3G and GG3B.

GG3F aims to reduce exposure to poor air quality which links to the goals of public open spaces but also of GG3C where a Healthy Streets Approach (HSA) is a priority. The HSA sets a framework for sustainable travel, cleaner air, places to rest and relaxing environments [@tfl2017].

```

Chapter 8 focuses on Green Infrastructure and Natural Environment and Chapter 9 on Sustainable Infrastructure, both are key to creating healthy cities.

#### Green Infrastructure and Natural Environment {#sec-gi}

*Policy G5 Urban Greening* (@fig-gla-g5) states that major development should conform to an Urban Greening Factor (UGF) which is a framework for judging how green a development should be. The scoring criteria provides a weighting on the type and maturity of green land cover.

#### Sustainable Infrastructure {#sec-si}

Chapter 9 focuses on Sustainable Infrastructure with goals relating to *Improving Air Quality* (SI1) and *Managing heat risk* (SI4). These interlink with the overaching policy of GG3 and the goals of Green Infrastructure (@sec-gi).

#### The roles of the London Boroughs {#sec-londonboroughs}

London Plan implementation is the responsibility of boroughs, whilst possibly equating to differing interpretations we must be aware of the diverse population and land cover of London.

Using the development of the UGF (@sec-gi) as an example. The framework remains ambiguous by allowing boroughs to develop their own UGF. Meaning there could be 32 different UGFs being applied. Although confusing, this is deliberate due to the diverse and distinct differences between boroughs. Considering the socio-demographic differences and the green space availability between boroughs (@gla2024a) and specifically between inner/outer London - it would be very difficult to identify the needs of each borough whilst generalising to all of London. Therefore allowing boroughs to implement their own localised UDF is appropriate.

## Implentation {#sec-implementation}

Policy GG3 (@sec-gg3) aims to create a healthy London for all but how can remote sensing help achieve this goal. I will explore how this is possible in the context of the specific policies mentioned in @sec-london-plan.

### Policy G5 - Urban Greening Factor {#sec-g5}

As existing green cover counts towards UGF scores, EO data can be used to reduce manual surveying and which can be monitored during development progress. Temporal comparison of green areas ensures developers meet targets and also help report on differences in percentage cover of green infrastructure which is fundamental to goals of the National Park City (@gla2025). High temporal availability of data allows comparison of green spaces in the past, present and future. In the UGF example we can calculate areas of different types of green spaces to be used for the UGF calculation, this could be extended further by using Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to assess the vegetation condition to ensure that green areas remain viable in future.

### Policy SI1 - Improving Air Quality {#sec-si1}

Sentinel-5 (S5P) provides data related to pollution-particles, such as NO~2~, SO~2~, CO and O~3~, so can be used to monitor air quality, however with a coarse spatial resolution identifying pollution hot spots may prove difficult without an element of enhancement.

With prepared data it's possible to monitor where pollution is prevalent and which particular particles are causing poor air quality allowing for targeted efforts in these areas. Whether through further monitoring using in-situ air quality monitors or prioritising improvement projects, including dual purpose urban/highway greening projects which meet the priorities of the HSA (@sec-gg3).

### Policy SI4 - Managing Heat Risk {#sec-si4}

Landsat 8/9 provides resampled thermal imagery at 30m spatial resolution (@almeida2021). This identifies areas at significant heat risk therefore allowing prioritisation of mitigation projects, or to build specific policies in specific areas such as through Neighbourhood Plans.

### Generalised Application - Highway Greening {#sec-hg}

In 2022/23, Camden and Islington used these policies to create the Green Infrastructure for Streets guidance (@lbclbiudl2024) and Highway Greening Accelerator programme (@camden2024) with the aim to improve microclimate, air quality and flood risk. Also the secondary benefits of improving biodiversity and street scenes which improve mental health therefore adhering to the HSA framework.

NDVI images were produced for vegetation identification (@fig-camden-ndvi), then combined with datasets like flood risk and public open space to build a weighted risk classification. This was fed into a site suitability analysis tool to build a dataset that is used to identify areas of increased need of urban greening.

## Reflection {#sec-4-reflection}

With 20 years Local Government experience, with 9 of those within Camden I believe I have a unique insight into how remote sensing is/could be used to meet the London Plan policies.

Firstly how is remote sensing used currently? The short answer is....*barely at all!*

Even some projects overseen by GLA such as their Climate Risk analysis are outsourced to companies like Bloomberg Associates (@gla2024) rather than procuring, processing and analysing the data in house.

> *"The view from above offers repeatable, independent, and cost effective ways for the digital (and smart) era to obtain relevant knowledge for social processes, ecological states, and technological innovations* — @wellmann2020

The cost of implementing remote sensing techniques into smaller boroughs is seen as outweighing the benefits. However as the quote from @wellmann2020 alludes to remotely sensed data is beginning to move more mainstream particularly with Google Earth Engine which removes much of the associated overheads.

Now that more readily available, cost effective tools are in place we must use this to showcase the benefits remote sensing brings at a policy level. By building specific pilot analysis projects like @sec-hg the benefits of such analysis can be brought to decision makers attention. I would be keen to take this further to build a tangible, reproducible product that could monitor Tree Canopy cover, as this has often been requested but without the resource or skills to implement. This is just one aspect can help achieve the London Plan goals that have already been discussed.
