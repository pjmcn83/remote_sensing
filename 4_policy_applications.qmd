# Policy Applications

## Introduction {#sec-4-intro}

### London {#sec-london}

-   Capital and most populous city in the UK, covering over1,500 square kilometres
-   Diverse population of over 8.5 million (@ons2021)
-   Varying land cover, with dense urban areas alongside extensive green spaces (@gla2025).
-   World's first National Park City - 50% green land cover by 2050 (@gla2025).
-   Divided into 32 boroughs with unique geographies, demographics, and autonomy

### London Plan {#sec-london-plan}

The London Plan is the strategic framework for the city's development, setting metropolitan policies for administrative boroughs to meet economic, social, and environmental responsibilities. It covers a wide range of topics, including building design, heritage, housing, economy, and transport.

#### GG3 Good Growth - Creating a healthy city {#sec-gg3}

Policy GG3 focuses on improving public health by increasing access to open spaces and reducing health problems caused by inactivity which specifically relate to GG3G and GG3B (@tbl-london_plan_gg3).

GG3F aims to reduce exposure to poor air quality which links to the goals of public open spaces but also of GG3C where a Healthy Streets Approach (HSA) is a priority. The HSA sets a framework for sustainable travel, cleaner air, places to rest and relaxing environments [@tfl2017].

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(here)
library(kableExtra)

#read in data
gg3 <- readxl::read_excel(here("tables", "londonplan_gg3.xlsx"))%>% 
  knitr::kable(booktabs = TRUE)%>% 
  kable_styling(position = "left", full_width = T)%>%
  # Merge the first row across two columns
  add_header_above(c("To improve Londoners’ health and reduce health inequalities, those involved in planning and development must:" = 2))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-london_plan_gg3
#| tbl-cap: "Policy GG3 of the London Plan"
gg3
```

Chapters 8 and 9 of the Plan focus on Green Infrastructure and Sustainable Infrastructure, both are crucial for creating healthy cities.

#### Green Infrastructure and Natural Environment {#sec-gi}

*Policy G5 Urban Greening* (@fig-gla-g5) requires major developments to meet an Urban Greening Factor (UGF) score which assesses the type and maturity of green cover in development projects.

#### Sustainable Infrastructure {#sec-si}

Chapter 9 focuses on Sustainable Infrastructure with goals relating to *Improving Air Quality* (SI1) and *Managing heat risk* (SI4). These interlink with the overarching policy of GG3 and the goals of Green Infrastructure (@sec-gi).

#### The roles of the London Boroughs {#sec-londonboroughs}

The London Plan is implemented by the boroughs, each with the responsibility to adapt policies to their unique needs. For example, the UGF framework allows boroughs to create their own UGF, meaning there could be 32 different interpretations. While this may seem confusing, it reflects the diversity of London’s socio-demographics and green space availability (@gla2024a). Allowing boroughs to localize the UGF is a practical approach given the varying needs of inner and outer London, as it would be problematic to identify the needs of each borough whilst generalising to all of London.

## Implentation {#sec-implementation}

Policy GG3 (@sec-gg3) aims to create a healthy London for all but how can remote sensing help achieve this goal? I will explore it's potential in the context of the specific policies mentioned in @sec-london-plan.

### Policy G5 - Urban Greening Factor {#sec-g5}

EO data can support UGF scores by reducing the need for manual surveying and allowing monitoring during development. Temporal comparisons of green spaces ensure developers meet targets and can report on changes in green infrastructure cover, which is key to the National Park City goal (@gla2025). High temporal availability allows for comparison across time, and NDVI can be used to assess vegetation condition, ensuring green areas remain viable in the future.

### Policy SI1 - Improving Air Quality {#sec-si1}

Sentinel-5 (S5P) provides data related to pollution-particles, such as NO~2~, SO~2~, CO and O~3~, making it useful for air quality monitoring. However with a coarse spatial resolution identifying pollution hot spots may prove difficult without an element of enhancement.

With prepared data it's possible to monitor where pollution is prevalent and which particular particles are causing poor air quality allowing for targeted efforts in these areas. Whether through further monitoring using in-situ air quality monitors or prioritising improvement projects, including dual purpose urban/highway greening projects which meet the priorities of the HSA (@sec-gg3).

### Policy SI4 - Managing Heat Risk {#sec-si4}

Landsat 8/9 provides resampled thermal imagery at 30m spatial resolution (@almeida2021), identifying areas at significant heat risk. This allows for prioritisation of mitigation projects and the development of specific policies through Neighbourhood Plans.

### Generalised Application - Highway Greening {#sec-hg}

In 2022/23, Camden and Islington used these policies to create the Green Infrastructure for Streets guidance (@lbclbiudl2024) and Highway Greening Accelerator programme (@camden2024) to improve microclimates, air quality and flood risk. Secondary benefits include improved biodiversity and street scenes that support mental health therefore adhering to the HSA framework.

NDVI images were used for vegetation identification (@fig-camden-ndvi), then combined flood risk and public open space data to build a weighted risk classification. This information was used in a site suitability analysis to identify areas of increased need of urban greening.

## Reflection {#sec-4-reflection}

With 20 years Local Government experience, including 9 of those within Camden, I have a unique perspective into how remote sensing can be utilised to meet the London Plan policies.

### Current Use

How is remote sensing used currently? The short answer is....*barely at all!*

Even some projects overseen by GLA, like the Climate Risk analysis are outsourced to companies like Bloomberg Associates (@gla2024) rather than procuring, processing and analysing the data in house.

> *"The view from above offers repeatable, independent, and cost effective ways for the digital (and smart) era to obtain relevant knowledge for social processes, ecological states, and technological innovations* — @wellmann2020

The cost of implementing remote sensing techniques in smaller boroughs is seen as outweighing the benefits. However as @wellmann2020 suggests, remotely sensed data is becoming more mainstream particularly with tools like Google Earth Engine which removes much of the associated overhead.

### The future

With more readily available and cost-effective tools, it is crucial to show the benefits of remote sensing at a policy level. By building pilot projects like @sec-hg we can demonstrate the value of such analysis to decision makers. I am keen to take this further by building a tangible, reproducible product for monitoring Tree Canopy cover - something that has been requested previously but without the resource or skills to implement. This is just one of many ways remote sensing can support the achievement of London Plan goals.
