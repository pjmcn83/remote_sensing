# Pléiades Neo Overview
.pull-left[
Pléiades Neo is actually a constellation of two* identical satellites
  - Pléiades Neo 3 launched 28th April 2021 
  - Pléiades Neo 4 launched 16th August 2021
  
Very hi-resolution (VHR) commercial constellation

Part of European Space Agency's third party missions

#Technical Specification

__Spectral Bands__

- Panchromatic: 450-800nm
- Deep Blue 400-450nm
- Blue 450-520nm
- Red 620-690nm
- Red Edge 700-750nm
- Red 620-690nm

__Sensor comparison__ `r Citet(myBib, "sce2022")`

| Sensor | Resolution | Swath Width |
|---|---|---|
|Pleiades Neo | Up to 0.3m |14km |
|Landsat-8 | Up to 15m | 185km |
|Sentinel 2 | Up to 10m | 185km |

__Constraints of hi-res sensors__

Increased cost of capture and file size leading to increased storage and processing costs.

Small swath width of hi-res sensor means more passes of the Earth required to capture the same area which further increases costs.

Increased processing times due to file size and amount of images required to combine to create study area.

# Use Cases

- Crisis Management
- Maritime Monitoring
- Agriculture
- Urban Planning
- Forestry
- Environmental Monitoring

There are many use cases for Pléiades Neo as shown above. 

These could be reviewed using sample images from the AirBus or ESA's website however in my work at London Borough of Camden we were lucky enough to take part in an EO Pilot scheme for the Public Sector which included access the Pleiades Neo images.

Therefore I can instead talk specifically about the Camden use case which looked at vegetation health.

# Vegetation Health 1
.pull-left[
__Output 1:__ *RGB image*

Demonstration of the level of resolution available from Pléiades Neo. Individual trees clearly visible and when zooming in vehicles are identifiable.
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/pleiades_rgb.png')
```
]
.pull-right[
__Output 2:__ *Near-infrared, Edge-infrared and Deep Blue image*

Highlighted where vegetation is (yellows and greens) against the urban areas (blue).  Smaller trees now identifiable.
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/pleiades_NIR_EIR_DeepBlue.png')
```
]

Used for identification purposes however faced technological constraints of hosting the data on shared drives and across networks.  Plus computational power of the machines were sub-standard as processing was very slow.

# Vegetation Health 2
__Output 3:__ *Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) image.*

To understand vegetation health between the two latest years available.

The two years were compared and could see a clear drop in the vegetation health in the second year.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap='NDVI 2022'}

knitr::include_graphics('./images/ndvi2023.png')

# Limitations 

__Expertise__

At the time of the pilot Camden lacked the time, resource, technology and expertise to analyse the EO data in a timely manner.  As such this was as far as the pilot got so further temporal data could not accessed for further comparison.

__Data__

Other issues we faced included accessing images for the right time of year. The images shown were from Autumn 2022 and 2023, therefore not the optimal time to accurately represent vegetation health.  Ideally images from Spring/early Summer would be used however the presence of excessive cloud cover in these images prevented their use.

__Cross referencing__

Time delays meant the pilot ended before we could enhance the analysis by identifying potential variables that could have affected the results. These could have included high temperatures, drought or flood events, and tree works affecting vegetation cover.

# The future - Pléiades Neo Next

.pull-left[
In April 2024 AirBus announced the Pléiades Neo Next programme.

Few details are currently available but it will provide native 20cm resolution imagery.

To launch in next few years and continue till at least 2040.

AirBus and others continue to push commercial EO capabilities with higher resolution capture.  This be seen by looking at the increase in high resolution sensors that are in orbit.

# Reflection

Pléiades Neo is already a very powerful constellation and with Pléiades Neo Next to follow in the next few years with an increased resolution there is a clear trend to constantly push to higher resolutions.

However, whilst increased spatial resolution is no doubt a good thing, in certain cases we must be mindful of the use cases of such data.  For example for land use classification sub 20cm resolution is excessive. Whereas if we need to identify individual trees or vehicles then this increased resolution can bring greater accuracy to analysis and policy making.

There is work ongoing that aims to make higher resolution imagery more accessible, particularly in UK Local Government, so we could be seeing a shift to more EO based decision making in Local Government in the coming years. Although access to data is one thing and possessing and implementing the skills to effectively make use of this is another issue entirely.

Particularly in Local Government there is also a prevalence of not optimal computational power which could severely hinder the feasiblity of using data at such a high resolution.
