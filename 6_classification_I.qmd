# Classification I

## Summary {#sec-6-summary}

This week we looked at how classification can help build important use cases for remote sensing. Starting with some practical use cases and then onto the theory and methods to produce outputs before practically applying this using Google Earth Engine. A recent example of remote sensing classification was that of the French authorities which identified undeclared private swimming pools and reclaimed â‚¬10m in revenue that otherwise wouldn't have been possible (@bbc2022). The driver for this was in response to drought, other use cases include illegal logging (@gonzales2019) and forest fires (@hansen2013).

### Classification

Traditionally there were two main forms of classification, according to @abburu2015 these can be defined as:

 - *Supervised*: requires human input to build a training set with the accuracy highly dependent on the samples used for training . Methods used include Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest.
 - *Unsupervised*: uses clustering methods to group pixels into clusters then an analyst assigns labels to the clusters. Most commonly used techniques are ISODATA, SVM and K-means
 

#### Object Based Image Analysis

Both the traditional methods use pixel-based processing whereas in the late 1990s object based classification has become increasingly popular through Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA).

OBIA groups pixels into an object type which are then as training data for the actual analysis.

The basic steps for all these forms of classification are expertly summarised by @gisgeography2014 and the steps involved can by shown in @fig-classification-infographic which also shows how OBIA has increased in popularity since 2006.

There is a clear trend of increased OBIA use from 2012 and it's unfortunate that an updated version of this infographic is not available. However

Why is OVIA preferred and is this correct??


## Application {#sec-6-application}

Look at specific methods of classification with brief description:

Classification and regression trees (CART)

Regression Trees

Cross Validation

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine

Create summary table of these methods and their preferred use cases plus pros and cons using specific examples

## Reflection {#sec-6-reflection}

talk about where to use this - example mentioned in previous weeks

how to identify specific method to use - blackbox graph for consideration
