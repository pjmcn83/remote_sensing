  abstract = {This paper presents a compendium of satellites under civilian and/or commercial control with the potential to gather global land-cover observations. From this we show that a growing number of sovereign states are acquiring capacity for space based land-cover observations and show how geopolitical patterns of ownership are changing. We discuss how the number of satellites flying at any time has progressed as a function of increased launch rates and mission longevity, and how the spatial resolutions of the data they collect has evolved. The first such satellite was launched by the USA in 1972. Since then government and/or private entities in 33 other sovereign states and geopolitical groups have chosen to finance such missions and 197 individual satellites with a global land-cover observing capacity have been successfully launched. Of these 98 were still operating at the end of 2013. Since the 1970s the number of such missions failing within 3years of launch has dropped from around 60\% to less than 20\%, the average operational life of a mission has almost tripled, increasing from 3.3years in the 1970s to 8.6years (and still lengthening), the average number of satellites launched per-year/per-decade has increased from 2 to 12 and spatial resolution increased from around 80m to less than 1m multispectral and less than half a meter for panchromatic; synthetic aperture radar resolution has also fallen, from 25m in the 1970s to 1m post 2007. More people in more countries have access to data from global land-cover observing spaceborne missions at a greater range of spatial resolutions than ever before. We provide a compendium of such missions, analyze the changes and shows how innovation, the need for secure data-supply, national pride, falling costs and technological advances may underpin the trends we document.},

  abstract = {The absolute atmospheric correction inputs are not always available, and then such parameters are assumed based on geographical location, acquisition time and sensor type. These assumptions can imply in errors in retrieving the remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs), and affects the optically active compounds estimates. As an alternative, relative atmospheric correction, i.e. radiometric normalization, can be used in cases where there is no information about atmospheric conditions. The main goal of this work was to perform a comparative analysis between absolute and relative atmospheric correction to estimate total suspended matter (TSM) concentrations in the Barra Bonita Hydroelectric Reservoir (São Paulo State, Brazil). The corrections were applied to the operational land imager, on-board Lansat-8 satellite. The Rrs errors from each correction were computed considering in situ data, and the lowest error was obtained for green spectral band (RMSEabsolute~=~11.5~\% and RMSErelative~=~12.3~\%). Using a regional algorithm that was developed using the in situ measurements (the model was TSM~=~1742.7*B3~−~5.42, with R2~=~0.60, p-value~=~0.05), the estimated TSM concentrations from absolute and relative corrections retrieved a RSME of 11 and 6~\%, respectively. The errors from absolute correction can be originated from the input parameters that were adopted, such as CO2 concentration, initial visibility, and water vapor information. The relative correction can be more appropriate in such cases because, besides atmospheric effects, the method try to minimize the illumination variability using normalization between temporal images, which improves the reflectances, and consequently, decreases TSM retrieval errors.},

  abstract = {Land cover mapping of large areas is challenging due to the significant volume of satellite data to acquire and process, as well as the lack of spatial continuity due to cloud cover. Temporal aggregation—the use of metrics (i.e., mean or median) derived from satellite data over a period of time—is an approach that benefits from recent increases in the frequency of free satellite data acquisition and cloud-computing power. This enables the efficient use of multi-temporal data and the exploitation of cloud-gap filling techniques for land cover mapping. Here, we provide the first formal comparison of the accuracy between land cover maps created with temporal aggregation of Sentinel-1 (S1), Sentinel-2 (S2), and Landsat-8 (L8) data from one-year and test whether this method matches the accuracy of traditional approaches. Thirty-two datasets were created for Wales by applying automated cloud-masking and temporally aggregating data over different time intervals, using Google Earth Engine. Manually processed S2 data was used for comparison using a traditional two-date composite approach. Supervised classifications were created, and their accuracy was assessed using field-based data. Temporal aggregation only matched the accuracy of the traditional two-date composite approach (77.9\%) when an optimal combination of optical and radar data was used (76.5\%). Combined datasets (S1, S2 or S1, S2, and L8) outperformed single-sensor datasets, while datasets based on spectral indices obtained the lowest levels of accuracy. The analysis of cloud cover showed that to ensure at least one cloud-free pixel per time interval, a maximum of two intervals per year for temporal aggregation were possible with L8, while three or four intervals could be used for S2. This study demonstrates that temporal aggregation is a promising tool for integrating large amounts of data in an efficient way and that it can compensate for the lower quality of automatic image selection and cloud masking. It also shows that combining data from different sensors can improve classification accuracy. However, this study highlights the need for identifying optimal combinations of satellite data and aggregation parameters in order to match the accuracy of manually selected and processed image composites.},

While these should, in principle, give broadly comparable measurements, any differences are a function not only of the differences in the sensor responses, but also of the spectral characteristics of the target pixels. In order to test for and quantify differences between these sensors, a large set of coincident imagery was assembled for the Australian landscape. Comparisons were carried out in terms of surface reflectance, and also in terms of biophysical quantities estimated from the reflectances. Small but consistent differences were found, and suitable adjustment equations fitted to enable transformation of Sentinel-2A reflectance values to more closely match Landsat-7 or Landsat-8 values. This is useful if trying to take models and thresholds fitted from Landsat and use them with Sentinel-2. The fitted adjustment equations were also compared against those fitted globally for NASA’s Harmonized Landsat-8 Sentinel-2 product, and found to be substantially different, raising the possibility that such adjustments need to be fitted on a regional basis.},

Its core role is to establish a quantitative relationship between the electromagnetic spectrum and the information obtained by the sensor and then use electromagnetic wave information to quantitatively detect all kinds of surface characteristic parameters. Quantitative remote sensing is based on the precise calibration of sensors and the atmospheric correction of remote sensing data. This chapter introduces the atmospheric effects on the process of remote sensing imaging and atmospheric correction to specifically discuss the utilization of atmospheric correction in processing remote sensing data. Section 1 presents the background of atmospheric effects. Section 2 discusses various algorithms for the estimation of aerosol properties, which are based on spectral, temporal, angular, spatial and polarization characteristics. Section 3 introduces the algorithms used for estimating atmospheric moisture content. Then, the influences of other atmospheric components and commonly used atmospheric correction models are illustrated. Finally, an application of atmospheric correction is presented.},

  abstract = {Accurate and real-time land use/land cover (LULC) maps are important to provide precise information for dynamic monitoring, planning, and management of the Earth. With the advent of cloud computing platforms, time series feature extraction techniques, and machine learning classifiers, new opportunities are arising in more accurate and large-scale LULC mapping. In this study, we aimed at finding out how two composition methods and spectral–temporal metrics extracted from satellite time series can affect the ability of a machine learning classifier to produce accurate LULC maps. We used the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform to create cloud-free Sentinel-2 (S-2) and Landsat-8 (L-8) time series over the Tehran Province (Iran) as of 2020. Two composition methods, namely, seasonal composites and percentiles metrics, were used to define four datasets based on satellite time series, vegetation indices, and topographic layers.

  abstract = {Accurate and real-time land use/land cover (LULC) maps are important to provide precise information for dynamic monitoring, planning, and management of the Earth. With the advent of cloud computing platforms, time series feature extraction techniques, and machine learning classifiers, new opportunities are arising in more accurate and large-scale LULC mapping. In this study, we aimed at finding out how two composition methods and spectral–temporal metrics extracted from satellite time series can affect the ability of a machine learning classifier to produce accurate LULC maps. We used the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform to create cloud-free Sentinel-2 (S-2) and Landsat-8 (L-8) time series over the Tehran Province (Iran) as of 2020. Two composition methods, namely, seasonal composites and percentiles metrics, were used to define four datasets based on satellite time series, vegetation indices, and topographic layers. The random forest classifier was used in LULC classification and for identifying the most important variables. Accuracy assessment results showed that the S-2 outperformed the L-8 spectral–temporal metrics at the overall and class level. Moreover, the comparison of composition methods indicated that seasonal composites outperformed percentile metrics in both S-2 and L-8 time series. At the class level, the improved performance of seasonal composites was related to their ability to provide better information about the phenological variation of different LULC classes.

  abstract = {Change detection methods for multi- and hypervariate data aim at identifying differences in data acquired over the same area at different points in time. In this contribution a regularized, iterative extension to the multivariate alteration detection (MAD) transformation for change detection is sketched and applied. The MAD transformation is based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA), which is an established technique in multivariate statistics. The extension in an iterative scheme seeks to establish an increasingly better background of no-change against which to detect change. This is done by putting higher weights on observations of no-change in the calculation of the statistics for the CCA.},

  abstract = {This paper describes new extensions to the previously published multivariate alteration detection (MAD) method for change detection in bi-temporal, multi- and hypervariate data such as remote sensing imagery. Much like boosting methods often applied in data mining work, the iteratively reweighted (IR) MAD method in a series of iterations places increasing focus on "difficult" observations, here observations whose change status over time is uncertain. The MAD method is based on the established technique of canonical correlation analysis: for the multivariate data acquired at two points in time and covering the same geographical region, we calculate the canonical variates and subtract them from each other. These orthogonal differences contain maximum information on joint change in all variables (spectral bands). The change detected in this fashion is invariant to separate linear (affine) transformations in the originally measured variables at the two points in time, such as 1) changes in gain and offset in the measuring device used to acquire the data, 2) data normalization or calibration schemes that are linear (affine) in the gray values of the original variables, or 3) orthogonal or other affine transformations, such as principal component (PC) or maximum autocorrelation factor (MAF) transformations. The IR-MAD method first calculates ordinary canonical and original MAD variates. In the following iterations we apply different weights to the observations, large weights being assigned to observations that show little change, i.e., for which the sum of squared, standardized MAD variates is small, and small weights being assigned to observations for which the sum is large. Like the original MAD method, the iterative extension is invariant to linear (affine) transformations of the original variables. To stabilize solutions to the (IR-)MAD problem, some form of regularization may be needed. This is especially useful for work on hyperspectral data. This paper describes ordinary two-set canonical correlation analysis, the MAD transformation, the iterative extension, and three regularization schemes. A simple case with real Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data at one point in time and (partly) constructed data at the other point in time that demonstrates the superiority of the iterative scheme over the original MAD method is shown. Also, examples with SPOT High Resolution Visible data from an agricultural region in Kenya, and hyperspectral airborne HyMap data from a small rural area in southeastern Germany are given. The latter case demonstrates the need for regularization},

  abstract = {This article identifies proxies which account for the impacts that the Airbnb platform is having on housing in Greater London. We identify these by analysing the relationships between possible Airbnb misuse and the attributes of housing in the same locations. We assume misuse when listings of entire properties within the Airbnb platform do not conform with local regulations and where hosts who offer such housing have multiple listings. In particular, we examine (1) the dwelling type based on building typology; (2) the type of housing tenure, whether it is owned or rented; and (3) the spatial distribution of changes in rent payable. Three important findings emerge from our analysis. First, based on 2018 data, we estimate that more than 2\% of all properties in London, and up to 7\% in some local areas are being misused through Airbnb as short-term holiday rentals. Second, the location of these particular Airbnb rentals is negatively correlated with the diversity of dwelling types and positively correlated with dwelling type such as an apartment (or flat) in areas of high private rental stock. Last, we show that a 100\% increase in the density of possible Airbnb misuse can be associated with up to an 8\% increase in unit rental price per-bedroom per-week, an equivalent to up to an average of £90 price increase per year. Finally, we discuss how this type of analysis can help build instruments to inform policies associated with the platform economy in relation to increasing polarisation in the London housing market.},

While the human eye detects color, Landsat sensors measure energy reflecting or emitted from the earth and relay that information as an image to users in varying degrees of greyscale. The higher the radiometric resolution, the more shades of grey the user sees. Landsat data are characterized by digital numbers. A 4-bit image indicates there are 16 digital values available ranging from 0 to 15. A 16-bit resolution image indicates there are 65,536 potential digital numbers between 0 to 65,535 for that sensor to record information. Since Landsat imagery is acquired in greyscale, the minimum (lowest) value is represented as black, and the maximum (highest) value is represented as white. Comparing a 4-bit image to a 16-bit image shows notable differences within the greyscale.},
