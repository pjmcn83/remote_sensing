  abstract = {Urban Heat Islands (UHI) consist of the occurrence of higher temperatures in urbanized areas when compared to rural areas. During the warmer seasons, this effect can lead to thermal discomfort, higher energy consumption, and aggravated pollution effects. The application of Remote Sensing (RS) data/techniques using thermal sensors onboard satellites, drones, or aircraft, allow for the estimation of Land Surface Temperature (LST). This article presents a systematic review of publications in Scopus and Web of Science (WOS) on UHI analysis using RS data/techniques and LST, from 2000 to 2020. The selection of articles considered keywords, title, abstract, and when deemed necessary, the full text. The process was conducted by two independent researchers and 579 articles, published in English, were selected. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed. Cfa climate areas are the most represented, as the Northern Hemisphere concentrates the most studied areas, especially in Asia (69.94\%); Landsat products were the most applied to estimates LST (68.39\%) and LULC (55.96\%); ArcGIS (30.74\%) was most used software for data treatment, and correlation (38.69\%) was the most applied statistic technique. There is an increasing number of publications, especially from 2016, and the transversality of UHI studies corroborates the relevance of this topic.},

Nowadays, pixel-based image classification technique is commonly performed with variety of algorithm such as minimum distance, parallelepiped, maximum likelihood, mahalanobis distance. On the other hand, landcover classification can also be acquired by using object-based image classification technique. In addition, object-based classification uses image segmentation from parameter such as scale, form, colour, smoothness and compactness. This research is aimed to compare the result of landcover classification and its change detection between parallelepiped pixel-based and object-based classification method. Location of this research is Bogor with 20 years range of observation from 1996 until 2016. This region is famous as urban areas which continuously change due to its rapid development, so that time-series landcover information of this region will be interesting.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing (RS) systems have been collecting massive volumes of datasets for decades, managing and analyzing of which are not practical using common software packages and desktop computing resources. In this regard, Google has developed a cloud computing platform, called Google Earth Engine (GEE), to effectively address the challenges of big data analysis. In particular, this platform facilitates processing big geo data over large areas and monitoring the environment for long periods of time. Although this platform was launched in 2010 and has proved its high potential for different applications, it has not been fully investigated and utilized for RS applications until recent years. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively explore different aspects of the GEE platform, including its datasets, functions, advantages/limitations, and various applications. For this purpose, 450 journal articles published in 150 journals between January 2010 and May 2020 were studied. It was observed that Landsat and Sentinel datasets were extensively utilized by GEE users. Moreover, supervised machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, were more widely applied to image classification tasks. GEE has also been employed in a broad range of applications, such as Land Cover/land Use classification, hydrology, urban planning, natural disaster, climate analyses, and image processing. It was generally observed that the number of GEE publications have significantly increased during the past few years, and it is expected that GEE will be utilized by more users from different fields to resolve their big data processing challenges.},

  abstract = {Future cities are set to face ever increasing population and climate pressures, ecosystem services offered by urban forests have been recognised as providing significant mitigation for these pressures. Therefore, the ability to accurately quantify the extent and structure of urban forests, across large and highly dynamic cities, is vital for determining the value of services provided and to assess the effectiveness of policy to promote these important assets. Current inventory methods used in urban forestry are mostly reliant on plot networks measuring a range of structural and demographic metrics; however, limited sampling (spatially and temporally) cannot fully capture the dynamics and spatial heterogeneity of the urban matrix. The rapid increase in the availability of open-access remote sensing data and processing tools offers an opportunity for monitoring and assessment of urban forest structure that is synoptic and at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Here we present a framework to estimate urban forest structure that uses open-access data and software, is robust to differences in data sources, is reproducible and is transferable between cities. The workflow is demonstrated by estimating three metrics of 3D forest structure (canopy cover, canopy height and tree density) across the Greater London area (1577\,km2). Random Forest was trained with open-access airborne LiDAR or iTree Eco inventory data, with predictor variables derived from Sentinel 2, climatic and topography data sets. Output were maps of forest structure at 100 m and 20 m resolution. Results indicate that forest structure can be accurately estimated across large urban areas; Greater London has a mean canopy cover of ∼16.5\% (RMSE 11-17\%), mean canopy height of 8.1–15.0\,m (RMSE 4.9–6.2\,m) m and is home to ∼4.6\,M large trees (projected crown area {$>$}10\,m2). Transferability to other cities is demonstrated using the UK city of Southampton, where estimates were generated from local and Greater London training data sets indicating application beyond geographic domains is feasible. The methods presented here can augment existing inventory practices and give city planners, urban forest managers and greenspace advocates across the globe tools to generate consistent and timely information to help assess and value urban forests.},

  abstract = {In the context of recent, highly destructive conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, reliable estimates of building damage are essential for an informed public discourse, human rights monitoring, and humanitarian aid provision. Given the contentious nature of conflict damage assessment, these estimates must be fully reproducible, explainable, and derived from open access data. This paper introduces a new method for building damage detection-- the Pixel-Wise T-Test (PWTT)-- that satisfies these conditions. Using a combination of freely-available synthetic aperture radar imagery and statistical change detection, the PWTT generates accurate conflict damage estimates across a wide area at regular time intervals. Accuracy is assessed using an original dataset of over half a million labeled building footprints spanning 12 cities across Ukraine, Palestine, Syria, and Iraq. Despite being simple and lightweight, the algorithm achieves building-level accuracy statistics (AUC=0.88 across Ukraine, 0.81 in Gaza) rivalling state of the art methods that use deep learning and high resolution imagery. The workflow is open source and deployed entirely within the Google Earth Engine environment, allowing for the generation of interactive Battle Damage Dashboards for Ukraine and Gaza that update in near-real time, allowing the public and humanitarian practitioners to immediately get estimates of damaged buildings in a given area.},

  abstract = {The Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 satellites carry on-board moderate resolution multispectral imagers for the purpose of documenting the Earth’s changing surface. Though they are independently built and managed, users will certainly take advantage of the opportunity to have higher temporal coverage by combining the datasets. Thus it is important for the radiometric and geometric calibration of the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and the Operational Land Imager (OLI) to be compatible. Cross-calibration of MSI to OLI has been accomplished using multiple techniques involving the use of pseudo-invariant calibration sites (PICS) using direct comparisons as well as through use of PICS models predicting top-ofatmosphere reflectance. A team from the University of Arizona is acquiring field data under both instruments for vicarious calibration of the sensors. This paper shows that the work done to date by the Landsat and Sentinel-2 calibration teams has resulted in stable radiometric calibration for each instrument and consistency to \textasciitilde 2.5\% between the instruments for all the spectral bands that the instruments have in common.},

From this we show that a growing number of sovereign states are acquiring capacity for space based land-cover observations and show how geopolitical patterns of ownership are changing. We discuss how the number of satellites flying at any time has progressed as a function of increased launch rates and mission longevity, and how the spatial resolutions of the data they collect has evolved. The first such satellite was launched by the USA in 1972. Since then government and/or private entities in 33 other sovereign states and geopolitical groups have chosen to finance such missions and 197 individual satellites with a global land-cover observing capacity have been successfully launched. Of these 98 were still operating at the end of 2013. Since the 1970s the number of such missions failing within 3years of launch has dropped from around 60\% to less than 20\%, the average operational life of a mission has almost tripled, increasing from 3.3years in the 1970s to 8.6years (and still lengthening), the average number of satellites launched per-year/per-decade has increased from 2 to 12 and spatial resolution increased from around 80m to less than 1m multispectral and less than half a meter for panchromatic; synthetic aperture radar resolution has also fallen, from 25m in the 1970s to 1m post 2007. More people in more countries have access to data from global land-cover observing spaceborne missions at a greater range of spatial resolutions than ever before. We provide a compendium of such missions, analyze the changes and shows how innovation, the need for secure data-supply, national pride, falling costs and technological advances may underpin the trends we document.},

  abstract = {The absolute atmospheric correction inputs are not always available, and then such parameters are assumed based on geographical location, acquisition time and sensor type. These assumptions can imply in errors in retrieving the remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs), and affects the optically active compounds estimates. As an alternative, relative atmospheric correction, i.e. radiometric normalization, can be used in cases where there is no information about atmospheric conditions. The main goal of this work was to perform a comparative analysis between absolute and relative atmospheric correction to estimate total suspended matter (TSM) concentrations in the Barra Bonita Hydroelectric Reservoir (São Paulo State, Brazil). The corrections were applied to the operational land imager, on-board Lansat-8 satellite. The Rrs errors from each correction were computed considering in situ data, and the lowest error was obtained for green spectral band (RMSEabsolute~=~11.5~\% and RMSErelative~=~12.3~\%). Using a regional algorithm that was developed using the in situ measurements (the model was TSM~=~1742.7*B3~−~5.42, with R2~=~0.60, p-value~=~0.05), the estimated TSM concentrations from absolute and relative corrections retrieved a RSME of 11 and 6~\%, respectively. The errors from absolute correction can be originated from the input parameters that were adopted, such as CO2 concentration, initial visibility, and water vapor information. The relative correction can be more appropriate in such cases because, besides atmospheric effects, the method try to minimize the illumination variability using normalization between temporal images, which improves the reflectances, and consequently, decreases TSM retrieval errors.},

  abstract = {Land cover mapping of large areas is challenging due to the significant volume of satellite data to acquire and process, as well as the lack of spatial continuity due to cloud cover. Temporal aggregation—the use of metrics (i.e., mean or median) derived from satellite data over a period of time—is an approach that benefits from recent increases in the frequency of free satellite data acquisition and cloud-computing power. This enables the efficient use of multi-temporal data and the exploitation of cloud-gap filling techniques for land cover mapping. Here, we provide the first formal comparison of the accuracy between land cover maps created with temporal aggregation of Sentinel-1 (S1), Sentinel-2 (S2), and Landsat-8 (L8) data from one-year and test whether this method matches the accuracy of traditional approaches. Thirty-two datasets were created for Wales by applying automated cloud-masking and temporally aggregating data over different time intervals, using Google Earth Engine. Manually processed S2 data was used for comparison using a traditional two-date composite approach. Supervised classifications were created, and their accuracy was assessed using field-based data. Temporal aggregation only matched the accuracy of the traditional two-date composite approach (77.9\%) when an optimal combination of optical and radar data was used (76.5\%). Combined datasets (S1, S2 or S1, S2, and L8) outperformed single-sensor datasets, while datasets based on spectral indices obtained the lowest levels of accuracy. The analysis of cloud cover showed that to ensure at least one cloud-free pixel per time interval, a maximum of two intervals per year for temporal aggregation were possible with L8, while three or four intervals could be used for S2. This study demonstrates that temporal aggregation is a promising tool for integrating large amounts of data in an efficient way and that it can compensate for the lower quality of automatic image selection and cloud masking. It also shows that combining data from different sensors can improve classification accuracy. However, this study highlights the need for identifying optimal combinations of satellite data and aggregation parameters in order to match the accuracy of manually selected and processed image composites.},

  abstract = {Climate change and global warming requires a strong boost to sustainable growth strategies. In particular, urban green management and planning is becoming a crucial and at the same time critical aspect. Therefore, urban green requires being accurately mapped, quantified and monitored over time. In this study we propose a cost-effective but reliable approach for the automatic classification and quantification of the tree canopy cover over extended geographical areas. The classification can also be used for estimating the number of trees, based on land use land cover (LULC) and the corresponding planting layout. The case study application is the Metropolitan City of Milan. Data used for classifying the tree canopy are based on high-resolution satellite imagery provided by the PlanetScope constellation. Based on the latter information, the work relies on the use of radiometric Vegetation Indices (VIs) to quantify the tree canopy. However, because the use of VIs can cause mixing of different types of vegetation, such as tree and grass, we used a stack of multi-temporal data from PlanetScope to retrieve per-pixel statistics for Red band and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The hypothesis here is that during spring-summer season tree canopy provides less variability than grass and/or agricultural fields. The approach provides an improved vegetation index capable of separating potential canopy-tree from other vegetation types. The result of the accuracy assessment shows an overall accuracy of 78.33\% and 71.5\% for the whole Metropolitan City of Milan and the City of Milan respectively.},

  abstract = {The temperature rise and increases in extreme heat events related to global climate change is a growing public health threat. Populations in temperate climates, including the UK, must urgently adapt to increased hot weather as current infrastructure primarily focusses on resilience to cold. As we adapt, care should be taken to ensure existing health inequalities are reduced. Lessons can be learned from regions that experience warmer climates and applied to adaptation in the UK. We identified known indicators of heat-health risk and explored their distribution across area level income for London. Understanding these indicators and their distributions across populations can support the development of interventions that have the dual aim of improving health and reducing inequalities. An exploratory analysis was conducted for each indicator at neighbourhood level to assess existence of disparities in their distributions across London. A systems-thinking approach was employed to deduce if these amount to systemic inequalities in heat risk, whereby those most exposed to heat are more susceptible and less able to adapt. Using this information, we proposed interventions and made recommendations for their implementation. We find inequalities across indicators relating to exposure, vulnerability, and adaptive capacity. Including inequalities in urban greening and access to greenspace, physical and mental health and access to communication and support. Through a system diagram we demonstrate how these indicators interact and suggest that systemic inequalities in risk exist and will become more evident as exposure increases with rising temperatures, depending on how we adapt. We use this information to identify barriers to the effective implementation of adaptation strategies and make recommendations on the implementation of interventions. This includes effective and wide-reaching communication considering the various channels and accessibility requirements of the population and consideration of all dwelling tenures when implementing policies relating to home improvements in the context of heat.},

While these should, in principle, give broadly comparable measurements, any differences are a function not only of the differences in the sensor responses, but also of the spectral characteristics of the target pixels. In order to test for and quantify differences between these sensors, a large set of coincident imagery was assembled for the Australian landscape. Comparisons were carried out in terms of surface reflectance, and also in terms of biophysical quantities estimated from the reflectances. Small but consistent differences were found, and suitable adjustment equations fitted to enable transformation of Sentinel-2A reflectance values to more closely match Landsat-7 or Landsat-8 values. This is useful if trying to take models and thresholds fitted from Landsat and use them with Sentinel-2. The fitted adjustment equations were also compared against those fitted globally for NASA’s Harmonized Landsat-8 Sentinel-2 product, and found to be substantially different, raising the possibility that such adjustments need to be fitted on a regional basis.},

  abstract = {The production of thematic maps, such as those depicting land cover, using an image classification is one of the most common applications of remote sensing. Considerable research has been directed at the various components of the mapping process, including the assessment of accuracy. This paper briefly reviews the background and methods of classification accuracy assessment that are commonly used and recommended in the research literature. It is, however, evident that the research community does not universally adopt the approaches that are often recommended to it, perhaps a reflection of the problems associated with accuracy assessment, and typically fails to achieve the accuracy targets commonly specified. The community often tends to use, unquestioningly, techniques based on the confusion matrix for which the correct application and interpretation requires the satisfaction of often untenable assumptions (e.g., perfect coregistration of data sets) and the provision of rarely conveyed information (e.g., sampling design for ground data acquisition). Eight broad problem areas that currently limit the ability to appropriately assess, document, and use the accuracy of thematic maps derived from remote sensing are explored. The implications of these problems are that it is unlikely that a single standardized method of accuracy assessment and reporting can be identified, but some possible directions for future research that may facilitate accuracy assessment are highlighted.},

  abstract = {Over the course of the 21st century, a century in which the urbanization process of the previous one is ever on the rise, the novel smart city concept has rapidly evolved and now encompasses the broader aspect of sustainability. Concurrently, there has been a sea change in the domain of Earth observation (EO) where scientific and technological breakthroughs are accompanied by a paradigm shift in the provision of open and free data. While the urban and EO communities share the end goal of achieving sustainability, cities still lack an understanding of the value EO can bring in this direction, an next a consolidated framework for tapping the full potential of EO and integrating it in their operational modus operandi. The “SMart URBan Solutions for air quality, disasters and city growth” H2020 project (SMURBS/ERA-PLANET) sits at this scientific and policy crossroad, and, by creating bottom-up EO-driven solutions against an array of environmental urban pressures, and by expanding the network of engaged and exemplary smart cities that push the state-of-the-art in EO uptake, brings the international ongoing discussion of EO for sustainable cities closer to home and contributes in this discussion. This paper advocates for EO as an integral part of a smart and sustainable city and aspires to lead by example. To this end, it documents the project’s impacts, ranging from the grander policy fields to an evolving portfolio of smart urban solutions and everyday city operations, as well as the cornerstones for successful EO integration. Drawing a parallel with the utilization of EO in supporting several aspects of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it aspires to be a point of reference for upcoming endeavors of city stakeholders and the EO community alike, to tread together, beyond traditional monitoring or urban planning, and to lay the foundations for urban sustainability.},

  abstract = {Quantification of global forest change has been lacking despite the recognized importance of forest ecosystem services. In this study, Earth observation satellite data were used to map global forest loss (2.3 million square kilometers) and gain (0.8 million square kilometers) from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil’s well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.},

  abstract = {The application of image texture to the digital analysis of remotely sensed data requires a quantitative characterization of texture. Several methods reported in the literature characterize the spatial distribution of gray levels across an image segment as texture measures. These texture measures represent all the pixels within an image segment as samples from the same population. Another approach to texture analysis is the construction of texture transforms consisting of discrete measures for each pixel. This technique describes the gray-level distributions around each pixel. This paper reports the analysis of texture transforms of multispectral digital imagery. The transforms were derived from local properties computed within three-by-three pixel windows surrounding each pixel. The local properties were computed using a combination of available channels. The properties included: the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of gray levels; mean and maximum gray-level differences; and mean and maximum Euclidean distances between gray level vectors. Logarithmic transformations of the local properties were used to expand the contrast of the texture transforms. Texture transforms of Landsat-2 MSS data were generated. The transforms were useful for edge detection and image enhancement, but did not prove useful as features for the thematic mapping of land cover. These results are compared to a previous investigation for which texture transforms of digitized aerial photography were effectively employed as features for the thematic mapping of terrain categories.},

Established towards the end of 2010, it provides access to satellite and other ancillary data, cloud computing, and algorithms for processing large amounts of data with relative ease. However, the uptake and usage of the opportunity remains varied and unclear. This study was undertaken to investigate the usage patterns of the Google Earth Engine platform and whether researchers in developing countries were making use of the opportunity. Analysis of published literature showed that a total of 300 journal papers were published between 2011 and June 2017 that used GEE in their research, spread across 158 journals. The highest number of papers were in the journal Remote Sensing, followed by Remote Sensing of Environment. There were also a number of papers in premium journals such as Nature and Science. The application areas were quite varied, ranging from forest and vegetation studies to medical fields such as malaria. Landsat was the most widely used dataset; it is the biggest component of the GEE data portal, with data from the first to the current Landsat series available for use and download. Examination of data also showed that the usage was dominated by institutions based in developed nations, with study sites mainly in developed nations. There were very few studies originating from institutions based in less developed nations and those that targeted less developed nations, particularly in the African continent.},

Its core role is to establish a quantitative relationship between the electromagnetic spectrum and the information obtained by the sensor and then use electromagnetic wave information to quantitatively detect all kinds of surface characteristic parameters. Quantitative remote sensing is based on the precise calibration of sensors and the atmospheric correction of remote sensing data. This chapter introduces the atmospheric effects on the process of remote sensing imaging and atmospheric correction to specifically discuss the utilization of atmospheric correction in processing remote sensing data. Section 1 presents the background of atmospheric effects. Section 2 discusses various algorithms for the estimation of aerosol properties, which are based on spectral, temporal, angular, spatial and polarization characteristics. Section 3 introduces the algorithms used for estimating atmospheric moisture content. Then, the influences of other atmospheric components and commonly used atmospheric correction models are illustrated. Finally, an application of atmospheric correction is presented.},

  abstract = {This work aims to clarify the potential of incoherent and coherent change detection (CD) approaches for detecting and monitoring ground surface changes using sequences of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Nowadays, the growing availability of remotely sensed data collected by the twin Sentinel-1A/B sensors of the European (EU) Copernicus constellation allows fast mapping of damage after a disastrous event using radar data. In this research, we address the role of SAR (amplitude) backscattered signal variations for CD analyses when a natural (e.g., a fire, a flash flood, etc.) or a human-induced (disastrous) event occurs. Then, we consider the additional pieces of information that can be recovered by comparing interferometric coherence maps related to couples of SAR images collected between a principal disastrous event date. This work is mainly concerned with investigating the capability of different coherent/incoherent change detection indices (CDIs) and their mutual interactions for the rapid mapping of “changed” areas. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have been demonstrated to be beneficial for handling the different information coming from coherent/incoherent CDIs in a unique corpus. Specifically, we used CDIs that synthetically describe ground surface changes associated with a disaster event (i.e., the pre-, cross-, and post-disaster phases), based on the generation of sigma nought and InSAR coherence maps. Then, we trained a random forest (RF) to produce CD maps and study the impact on the final binary decision (changed/unchanged) of the different layers representing the available synthetic CDIs. The proposed strategy was effective for quickly assessing damage using SAR data and can be applied in several contexts. Experiments were conducted to monitor wildfire’s effects in the 2021 summer season in Italy, considering two case studies in Sardinia and Sicily. Another experiment was also carried out on the coastal city of Houston, Texas, the US, which was affected by a large flood in 2017; thus, demonstrating the validity of the proposed integrated method for fast mapping of flooded zones using SAR data.},

Several improvements in the techniques and datasets quality led to more effective, near real time assessment and response, and a greater ability of constraining dynamically changing physical processes. Using examples of the COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) system, we present a methodology that bridges the gaps between MT-InSAR and the relative stiffness method for tunnel-induced subsidence damage assessment. The results allow quantification of the effect of the building on the settlement profile. As expected the greenfield deformation assessment tends to provide a conservative estimate in the majority of cases (\textasciitilde 71\% of the analyzed buildings), overestimating tensile strains up to 50\%. With this work we show how these two techniques in the field of remote sensing and structural engineering can be synergistically used to complement and replace the traditional ground based analysis by providing an extended coverage and a temporally dense set of data.},

In this contribution a regularized, iterative extension to the multivariate alteration detection (MAD) transformation for change detection is sketched and applied. The MAD transformation is based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA), which is an established technique in multivariate statistics. The extension in an iterative scheme seeks to establish an increasingly better background of no-change against which to detect change. This is done by putting higher weights on observations of no-change in the calculation of the statistics for the CCA.},

  abstract = {This paper describes new extensions to the previously published multivariate alteration detection (MAD) method for change detection in bi-temporal, multi- and hypervariate data such as remote sensing imagery. Much like boosting methods often applied in data mining work, the iteratively reweighted (IR) MAD method in a series of iterations places increasing focus on "difficult" observations, here observations whose change status over time is uncertain. The MAD method is based on the established technique of canonical correlation analysis: for the multivariate data acquired at two points in time and covering the same geographical region, we calculate the canonical variates and subtract them from each other. These orthogonal differences contain maximum information on joint change in all variables (spectral bands). The change detected in this fashion is invariant to separate linear (affine) transformations in the originally measured variables at the two points in time, such as 1) changes in gain and offset in the measuring device used to acquire the data, 2) data normalization or calibration schemes that are linear (affine) in the gray values of the original variables, or 3) orthogonal or other affine transformations, such as principal component (PC) or maximum autocorrelation factor (MAF) transformations. The IR-MAD method first calculates ordinary canonical and original MAD variates. In the following iterations we apply different weights to the observations, large weights being assigned to observations that show little change, i.e., for which the sum of squared, standardized MAD variates is small, and small weights being assigned to observations for which the sum is large. Like the original MAD method, the iterative extension is invariant to linear (affine) transformations of the original variables. To stabilize solutions to the (IR-)MAD problem, some form of regularization may be needed. This is especially useful for work on hyperspectral data. This paper describes ordinary two-set canonical correlation analysis, the MAD transformation, the iterative extension, and three regularization schemes. A simple case with real Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data at one point in time and (partly) constructed data at the other point in time that demonstrates the superiority of the iterative scheme over the original MAD method is shown. Also, examples with SPOT High Resolution Visible data from an agricultural region in Kenya, and hyperspectral airborne HyMap data from a small rural area in southeastern Germany are given. The latter case demonstrates the need for regularization},

  abstract = {Monitoring salt marshes with remote sensing is necessary to evaluate their state and restoration. Determining appropriate techniques for this can be overwhelming. Our study provides insight into whether a pixel- or object-based Random Forest classification approach is best for mapping vegetation in north temperate salt marshes. We used input variables from drone images (raw reflectances, vegetation indices, and textural features) acquired in June, July, and August 2021 of a salt marsh restoration and reference site in Aulac, New Brunswick, Canada. We also investigated the importance of input variables and whether using landcover classes representing areas of change was a practical way to evaluate variation in the monthly images. Our results indicated that (1) the classifiers achieved overall validation accuracies of 91.1–95.2\%; (2) pixel-based classifiers outperformed object-based classifiers by 1.3–2.0\%; (3) input variables extracted from the August images were more important than those extracted from the June and July images; (4) certain raw reflectances, vegetation indices, and textural features were among the most important variables; and (5) classes that changed temporally were mapped with user’s and producer’s validation accuracies of 86.7–100.0\%. Knowledge gained during this study will inform assessments of salt marsh restoration trajectories spanning multiple years.},

Statistically robust and transparent approaches for assessing accuracy and estimating area of change are critical to ensure the integrity of land change information. We provide practitioners with a set of “good practice” recommendations for designing and implementing an accuracy assessment of a change map and estimating area based on the reference sample data. The good practice recommendations address the three major components: sampling design, response design and analysis. The primary good practice recommendations for assessing accuracy and estimating area are: (i) implement a probability sampling design that is chosen to achieve the priority objectives of accuracy and area estimation while also satisfying practical constraints such as cost and available sources of reference data; (ii) implement a response design protocol that is based on reference data sources that provide sufficient spatial and temporal representation to accurately label each unit in the sample (i.e., the “reference classification” will be considerably more accurate than the map classification being evaluated); (iii) implement an analysis that is consistent with the sampling design and response design protocols; (iv) summarize the accuracy assessment by reporting the estimated error matrix in terms of proportion of area and estimates of overall accuracy, user's accuracy (or commission error), and producer's accuracy (or omission error); (v) estimate area of classes (e.g., types of change such as wetland loss or types of persistence such as stable forest) based on the reference classification of the sample units; (vi) quantify uncertainty by reporting confidence intervals for accuracy and area parameters; (vii) evaluate variability and potential error in the reference classification; and (viii) document deviations from good practice that may substantially affect the results. An example application is provided to illustrate the recommended process.},

HazMapper is an open-access hazard mapping application developed in Google Earth Engine that allows users to derive map and GIS-based products from Sentinel or Landsat datasets without the time- and cost-intensive resources required for traditional analysis. The first iteration of HazMapper relies on a vegetation-based metric, the relative difference in the normalized difference vegetation index (rdNDVI), to identify areas on the landscape where vegetation was removed following a natural disaster. Because of the vegetation-based metric, the tool is typically not suitable for use in desert or polar regions. HazMapper is not a semi-automated routine but makes rapid and repeatable analysis and visualization feasible for both recent and historical natural disasters. Case studies are included for the identification of landslides and debris flows, wildfires, pyroclastic flows, and lava flow inundation. HazMapper is intended for use by both scientists and non-scientists, such as emergency managers and public safety decision-makers.},

  abstract = {This article identifies proxies which account for the impacts that the Airbnb platform is having on housing in Greater London. We identify these by analysing the relationships between possible Airbnb misuse and the attributes of housing in the same locations. We assume misuse when listings of entire properties within the Airbnb platform do not conform with local regulations and where hosts who offer such housing have multiple listings. In particular, we examine (1) the dwelling type based on building typology; (2) the type of housing tenure, whether it is owned or rented; and (3) the spatial distribution of changes in rent payable. Three important findings emerge from our analysis. First, based on 2018 data, we estimate that more than 2\% of all properties in London, and up to 7\% in some local areas are being misused through Airbnb as short-term holiday rentals. Second, the location of these particular Airbnb rentals is negatively correlated with the diversity of dwelling types and positively correlated with dwelling type such as an apartment (or flat) in areas of high private rental stock. Last, we show that a 100\% increase in the density of possible Airbnb misuse can be associated with up to an 8\% increase in unit rental price per-bedroom per-week, an equivalent to up to an average of £90 price increase per year. Finally, we discuss how this type of analysis can help build instruments to inform policies associated with the platform economy in relation to increasing polarisation in the London housing market.},

  abstract = {Radiometric resolution relates to how much information is perceived by a satellite’s sensor. While the human eye detects color, Landsat sensors measure energy reflecting or emitted from the earth and relay that information as an image to users in varying degrees of greyscale. The higher the radiometric resolution, the more shades of grey the user sees. Landsat data are characterized by digital numbers. A 4-bit image indicates there are 16 digital values available ranging from 0 to 15. A 16-bit resolution image indicates there are 65,536 potential digital numbers between 0 to 65,535 for that sensor to record information. Since Landsat imagery is acquired in greyscale, the minimum (lowest) value is represented as black, and the maximum (highest) value is represented as white. Comparing a 4-bit image to a 16-bit image shows notable differences within the greyscale.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing has evolved to become a key tool for various fields of environmental analysis, thus actively informing policy across areas and domains. To evaluate the degree to which remote sensing is contributing to the science of ecologically-oriented urban planning, we carried out a systematic literature review using the SCOPUS database, searching for articles integrating knowledge in urban planning, remote sensing and ecology. We reviewed 186 articles, analysing various issues in urban environments worldwide. Key findings include that the level of integration between the three disciplines is limited, with only 12\% of the papers fully integrating ecology, remote sensing and planning while 24\% of the studies use specific methods from one domain only. The vast majority of studies is oriented towards contributing to the knowledge base or monitoring the impacts of existing policies. Few studies are directly policy relevant by either contributing to direct issues in planning and making specific design suggestions or evaluations. The accessibility of the scientific findings remains limited, as the majority of journal articles are not open access and proprietary software and data are frequently used. To overcome these issues, we suggest three future avenues for science as well as three potential entry points for remote sensing into applied urban planning. By doing so, remote sensing data could become a vital tool actively contributing to policies, civil engagement and concrete planning measures by providing independent and cost effective environmental analyses.},

  abstract = {Current marine research that leverages remote sensing data urgently requires gridded data of high spatial and temporal resolution. However, such high-quality data is often lacking due to the inherent physical and technical constraints of sensors. A necessary trade-off therefore exists between spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution in satellite remote sensing technology: increasing spatial resolution often reduces the coverage area, thereby diminishing temporal resolution. This manuscript introduces an innovative remote sensing image fusion algorithm that combines Sentinel-2 (high spatial resolution) and Sentinel-3 (relatively high spectral and temporal resolution) satellite data. The algorithm, based on a cross-attention mechanism and referred to as the Cross-Attention Spatio-Temporal Spectral Fusion (CASTSF) model, accounts for variations in spectral channels, spatial resolution, and temporal phase among different sensor images. The proposed method enables the fusion of atmospherically corrected ocean remote sensing reflectance products (Level 2 OSR), yielding high-resolution spatial data at 10 m resolution with a temporal frequency of 1–2 days. Subsequently, the algorithm generates chlorophyll-a concentration remote sensing products characterized by enhanced spatial and temporal fidelity. A comparative analysis against existing chlorophyll-a concentration products demonstrates the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach, highlighting its potential for advancing remote sensing applications.},
