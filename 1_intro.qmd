# Introduction to Remote Sensing {intro-remote-sensing}

## Summary {#sec-1-summary}

As a relative newbie to remote sensing there was so much new information this week that it's very difficult to choose even a few things to talk about without writing an whole essay. Therefore I have decided that the best way to summarise this would be through a mind map @fig-rsintro.

There are so many topics that could be discussed further but to focus quickly on the spectral bands. Images produced at different bands are what make up the creation of useful and relevant images. I have previously attempted to use earth observation data without understanding the differences between the bands and this made the task incredibly difficult, leading me to mindlessly follow guides and videos just to produce a semi-readable output. So this weeks introduction to remote sensing really helped me to understand what bands relate to which information on the ground. And importantly how the different bands can be combined depending on the purpose of any analysis. The list of use cases from combining spectral bands is incredible, [EOS](https://eos.com/make-an-analysis/) and [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-are-best-landsat-spectral-bands-use-my-research) provide a succinct summary of some of the common use cases.

Whilst many of the use cases available are fascinating, as this is an introduction to remote sensing it would be easy to get lost in the amount of use cases on offer. Given the vast number of use cases, I’ve chosen to focus on comparing two widely available satellites, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2.

## Application {#sec-1-application}

The summary table (@tbl-landsat_sentinel_comparison) highlights key differences between Landsat-8 (LS8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) particularly in spatial resolution and number of bands. However there are six comparable bands which means we can use the data of each satellite to compare against each other. This has the bonus of greater temporal availability. However, subtle differences in wavelengths should be considered when making comparisons. The differences in spatial resolution should also be considered and may require resampling dependent on use case.

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(here)
library(kableExtra)

#read in data
comp <- read.csv(here("tables", "landsat_sentinel_comparison.csv"), check.names = F)%>% 
  knitr::kable(booktabs = TRUE)%>% 
  kable_styling(position = "center", full_width = T)%>%
  # any specifc row changes you want
    row_spec(.,
  row=0,
  bold = TRUE)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-landsat_sentinel_comparison
#| tbl-cap: "Summary comparison of basic Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 specifications @mandanici2016"
comp
```

Various methodologies can be employed to compare LS8 and S2, @mandanici2016 uses regression/correlation methods whereas @nasiri2022 complements this using visual comparisons. Both approaches are effective, though visual comparisons are more accessible for policymakers, whereas statistical methods provide deeper insights into sensor performance.

The statistical approach [@mandanici2016] showed a positive correlation between the corresponding bands. Although limitations identified included radiometric differences and discrepancies in reflectance value's relevance. The radiometric differences are identified as \~2.5% for all common bands (@barsi2018), the significance of which is dependent on use-case. The importance of statistical methods is highlighted by visualising differences between LS8 and S2 @fig-nasiri-fci. While the S2 image appears slightly darker, distinguishing significant differences remains challenging. Therefore at this level of analysis it could be suitable to use either sensor's data.

For more detailed analysis the sensor's differences begin to have greater influence. Particularly evident in [@fig-nasiri-results] where artificial land identified by LS8 (DS4) within the water body is far greater than the S2 image (D2). This highlights how the choice of dataset depends on the specific use case.

### Limitations {#sec-1-limitations}

The work of @mandanici2016 appears less reproducible as there is less transparency about the tools used. This may be because proprietary applications were required for the analysis. Additionally, this is a comparison paper so the specific methodology and tools used may be seen as insignificant compared to the results. In contrast, @nasiri2022 are more transparent about their use of Google Earth Engine (GEE). GEE mitigates local storage issues and provides greater computational power for analysis and processing making it more accessible and cost-effective solution [@carrasco2019].

A common issue of remote sensing papers is the small samples used. Therefore it cannot be said with certainty whether results would be replicated in other areas. @mandanici2016 choose sites of differing landscapes and climate, @nasiri2022 used a single area with distinguishable land uses. Whilst useful it's not clear whether similar results are expected in other areas of interest. Although computational resource, time and localised factors would greatly restrict larger area analysis.

## Reflection {#sec-1-reflection}

This week introduced a range of new topics that we could barely scratch the surface of, however this diary entry and reading the articles discussed in @sec-1-application has really helped better shape my understanding of these areas. Previously, I assumed that the highest spatial resolution was always the best, but it's clear that the optimal choice depends on the specific use case. Balancing spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution—as well as costs—is crucial to ensuring meaningful analysis.

A key takeaway is how the different spectral bands and their wavelengths serve distinct purposes. This will be extremely useful in the coming months, both in this course and CASA0025, but also as in my role in Local Government as we begin to use a new Earth Observation Data Hub. I'm excited to explore the tools available and understand how selecting the right sensor data can dictate the success of our work.
